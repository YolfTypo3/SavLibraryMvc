What Does it Do?

The SAV Library Mvc is the library required to run extension
generated by means of the `SAV Library Kickstarter <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/sav_library_kickstarter>`_ when the library
type **Mvc** is used.

The SAV Library Kickstrater generates extensions **without any PHP
coding**, thanks to simple configuration parameters. It includes:

- Creation of multiple views of the data,
- Front end input of the data,
- Views with folders,
- Simple interface in the Kickstarter with Context Sensitive Help,
- Generation of emails,
- Generation of RTF files using database tags,
- Data export in CSV format,
- Many other features.

The latest developments of the SAV Library Mvc extension are
available in GitHub ( `SAV Library Mvc
<https://github.com/YolfTypo3/SavLibraryMvc>`_ ).


.. important::

    The SAV Library Mvc is in beta state because many configuration features available in SAV Library Plus 
    are not yet implemented. However
    simple extensions, that is extensions which do not require complex configuration, can be already generated.
    
    A test extension `SAV Library Mvc Example0 <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/sav_librarymvc_example0>`_ 
    is available in the TER. It implements the same feature as `SAV Library Example0 
    <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/sav_library_example0>`_ which 
    is the test extension for SAV Library Plus.
    
    If you are not familiar with SAV Library, please read first the tutorial in the :ref:`SAV Library Kickstarter 
    manual <savlibrarykickstarter:tutorial>`. It
    shows the basic steps for creating and installing an extension.
    
    You can also read the tutorial sections in `SAV Library Plus manual 
    <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/sav_library_plus/>`_.
